What does tidying your house and writing software have in common? The answer to this question is important because it will guide us in our search for a solution. It turns out, to the best I can see, that software engineering and tidying are both battles against the same ancient enemy - and one they are both destined to lose - entropy.

You might wonder what on earth entropy, a concept encoded in the second law of thermodynamics, has to do with software and tidying up. I am making use of an analogy here to some degree, but entropy is also a well-defined concept in information theory[1,2]. The key take-away from both definitions is that the "disorder" of a system is related or correlated with the number of possible states in that system. The second law even states that systems will tend to move to higher entropy states over time, which I would guess is something most people can relate to in terms of tidiness.
